<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

<p>

## Step 2: Promote DC-1 to Domain Controller


2. Click on the flag at the top right of the screen with the warning sign  
   - Promote DC-1 to Domain Controller
   - Setup a new foret as "mydomain.com"
   - Restart and then log back into DC-1 as user: mydomain.com\reggie-admin

<p>







## Step 3: Create an Organizational Unit(OU) named _EMPLOYEES and _ADMINS

   - Right click on mydomain.com and select New and click on Organizational Unit

- Create OU_EMPLOYEES and _ADMINS

<p>




## Step 4: Create a Domain Admin user within the domain


   - Right click on the OU  _ADMINS and create a new user named Jane Doe.
   - With the username jane_admin  

<img width="827" height="497" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 103920" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52be3374-5a35-4afd-823c-65ad6d7f6e34" />
<p>




## Step 5: Add jane_admin to the "Domain Admins" Security Group 


   - Turn Jane Doe into an admin by right clicking her name > properties
   - member of and adding her to the "Domain Admins" Security Group

<img width="829" height="495" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 104037" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e911f82c-4922-49ea-a400-afaf42c1e959" />

<p>


## Step 6: Log out of DC-1 to log back in as Jane Doe


   - Log back in as "mydomain.com\jane_admin"
   - Use jane_admin as your admin account from now on

<img width="453" height="557" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 104858" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2406d9b-e020-47ef-8727-cc6a44ddbd49" />


<p>



## Step 7: Login to Client-1 as the original local admin and join it to the domain  (Computer will restart

   - Right click the start menu > click system > click rename this pc advanced
   - Under the computer name tab, click on "Change"
   - Join it to the domain "mydomain.com"

 - Enter the name and password of an account with permission to join the domain.
 - Use the account: mydomain.com\jane_admin
 - Once Client-1 has been added, the VM will restart.

<p>

## Step 8: Login to the Domain Controller and verify Client-1 shows up in ADUC

   - Expand mydomain.com then go to "computers" to verify

<p>

## Step 9: Create a new OU named "_CLIENTS" and drag Client-1 into there

<p>


## Step 10: Setting up RDP & User Accounts via PowerShell

   - Setup RDP for non-administrative users on Client-1
   - We have to login to Client-1 as an admin (using mydomain.com\jane_admin) right click the start menu and open system.
   - Click on "Remote Desktop" on User Accounts and click "Select users that can remotely access this PC"
   - Allow "Domain Users" access to remote desktop.
   - After completing those steps you should be able to log into Client-1 as normal user (any user).

<p>


## Step 11: Run Powershell script

   - Use a Powershell script to generate a number of users for our Active Directory Domain.
   - Login to DC-1 as mydomain.com\jane_admin
   - Open Powershell_ISE as an administrator and create a new file then save
   - [(https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1)]
   - Paste the script to generate thousands of users into the domain.
   - Run Script

<img width="827" height="495" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 105259" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aae0939-8ea6-4bd3-b001-537a460a9a14" />

- When finished, open ADUC and observe the accounts in the appropriate OU  "_EMPLOYEES"

<img width="828" height="495" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 105319" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31ee762b-8696-4dbd-85d9-873952f806b1" />






<p>


## Step 12: Login as any user
  
  - Now you can login as any of the users that was created by the script to further verify that the script has worked.
  - Take note of the default password in the script (Password1) for all users.

As you can see the Powershell script created a user with the username "bid.tuk". We were able to login to Client-1 with his credentials as a normal user.
